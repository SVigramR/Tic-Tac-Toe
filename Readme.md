# Tic Tac Toe
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game repository! This game is created in part of The Odin Project curriculum. The game is created only using Vanilla Javascript, HTML5, CSS3. I used the factory function to create the game controller which enabled me to create 3x3 game and set  object expression which enabled me to create my own methods for the game. This helped me to set value of the cell and check for tie or win.
